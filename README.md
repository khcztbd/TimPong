# TimPong - Classic Pong Game
## Tim Brailsford, 2015

This is a simple Java Pong game written for teaching purposes.

This game has limited features (e.g. no sound) and is quite incomplete (e.g. 
console rather than on-screen scoring).  It was originally written as a 
tutorial for teaching the rudiments of object oriented programming using 
Java.
